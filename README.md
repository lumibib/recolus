## üëã Introduction

Self-hosted, Laravel PHP based analytics tool for those who care about privacy. Recolus runs on your own server, analyzes the traffic of your websites and provides useful statistics in a minimal interface.

We believe that you don't need to track every aspect of your visitors. Recolus keeps tracked data anonymized to avoid that users are identifiable, while still providing helpful insights. It's the right tool for everyone who doesn't need a full-featured marketing analytics platform like Google Analytics or Matomo.

## Install

Follow this instructions to "install" Recolus.

### 1. Download the source code

Clone this repository or [download it](https://github.com/lumibib/recolus/archive/master.zip) as an archive and decompress-it.

**A. Using `git clone`**

```bash
cd /var/www # Or wherever you chose to install web applications to
git clone https://github.com/lumibib/recolus.git
cd recolus
git tag -l

# Examples below
v1.0.0
v1.1.0
v2.0.0
v2.1.0
```

```bash
git checkout v2.1.0
```
> ‚ÑπÔ∏è The tags below are examples of what will be shown. You should always run git checkout on the latest tag. Recolus is constantly evolving therefore, we advise you to always download and use the latest tagged release. Using a non-tagged release or the `main` branch may result in an unstable or broken environment.

**B. Download the zip archive**

[Download Recolus](https://github.com/lumibib/recolus/archive/master.zip) as an archive and decompress it where you install web applications on your server.

### 2. Install Composer

If not already installed, [install composer](https://getcomposer.org/download/).

And then install required packages.

```bash
composer update --no-dev -o
```

### 3. Install Recolus

Recolus comes with an installation command that will:

- Configure database
- Configure environment
- Create an admin user
- Run migrations
- Run seeders (for demo if you want)

Follow the instructions running this command in your terminal at the root of your project (`cd PATH_TO_RECOLUS_ROOT`).

```bash
php artisan recolus:install
```

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è Getting a 500 - Internal Server Error?
> If you get a 500 error when visiting your status page, you may need to run `chmod -R 777 storage` for it to work or `rm -rf bootstrap/cache/*`. You can also try to give permissions to cache `chmod -R 777 bootstrap/`

### 4. Configure the database

By default Recolus comes with a `.env.example` file. You'll need to rename this file to just `.env` regardless of what environment you're working on.

It's now just a case of editing this new `.env` file and setting the values of your setup.

> You can configure database with `php artisan recolus:install` command or manually.

## Update

If you've installed Recolus using Git, then upgrading should be straight forward, requiring just a few minutes.

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è Before you get started, backup!
> Make sure that you've taken a backup of your Recolus database. We test thoroughly, but you never know.

Follow the instructions running this command in your terminal at the root of your project (`cd PATH_TO_RECOLUS_ROOT`).

```bash
php artisan recolus:update
```

If you want, you can update with theses command and then run `php artisan recolus:update` again :

```bash
git fetch origin main
git tag -l
git checkout LATEST_TAG
```
> Checking out a LATEST_TAG value won't work. You need to replace this with the latest version from the output of git tag -l.
